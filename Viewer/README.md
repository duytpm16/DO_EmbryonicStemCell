Which one is right?? Need to discuss at meeting...



***Version 2*** contains DO mESC Proteomics dataset in QTL Viewer format with 4 weird samples as duplicates of the one it is highly correlated to and quantile normalization on the proteomics.

***Version 2.1*** contains DO mESC Proteomics dataset in QTL Viewer format with 4 weird samples as duplicates of the one it is highly correlated to and log transform the proteomics.



***Version 3*** contains DO mESC Proteomics dataset in QTL Viewer format which removes the 4 weird samples and quantile normalization on the proteomics and then log.

***Version 3.1*** contains DO mESC Proteomics dataset in QTL Viewer format which removes the 4 weird samples and log transform the proteomics since Gygi lab already normalized.
